# 🛒 Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis  
Instacart Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Cleaning

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior using the Instacart dataset. The objective is to clean and preprocess transactional grocery data and extract meaningful insights about customer ordering patterns, product preferences, and purchasing frequency.

The dataset was adapted from the original Instacart Kaggle competition data and includes missing values and duplicates to simulate real-world data challenges.
